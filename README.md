- 👋 Hi, I’m @VelvetLounger

- 👀 I’m interested in computing and my car.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to communicate with my Audi using CANbus. My project is to look for codes that tell the dashboard lights to get brighter or dimmer. Then sending that data on to a turbo boost gauge LED that was recently installed and is always too bright. The next step is to sucessfully switch a fuse on a 32u4 chip. Then get a custom PCB fabricated and populated.

- 💞️ I don't have any particular projects I want to collaborate on. Honestly I am not the best coder. I tend to look for code similar to what I need, then figure out how to try and tweak it. My background is a diploma in Automation Robotics, and then 20 years of Project Management in the Building Automation Controls field. I like mucking around with Arduino and various Adafruit micro controllers for various small projects.
